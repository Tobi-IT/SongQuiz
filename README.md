# SongQuiz
Developing a song quiz website with backend support: Automatic downloading of songs from YouTube, splitting them into instruments and vocals using AI. Players guess the song step by step, with an optional multiplayer mode where speed earns points. The aim is to win after several rounds.
I dont know about Licencing so i wont add any songs myself but will maybe write an Import function so a Playlist or something similar can be used.
